<h2>The band</h2>
<p>In summer, 2004, Taras Topolia together with his friends performs his own song of the same name ‘Antytila’ on his
    Prom Night. It is about the opposites that differ greatly but can’t live without one another. The song’s name will
    become the name of the band in future, and the meaning of this word will go deeper philosophically.
